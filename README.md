# FIR Filters in EEG Signal Processing

This repository provides a detailed overview of FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters and their application in EEG (electroencephalography) signal processing. It includes theoretical explanations and practical examples for designing and using FIR filters to enhance EEG signal analysis.

## Overview

FIR filters are a fundamental tool in digital signal processing, used to modify or extract specific frequency components from a signal. In EEG signal processing, FIR filters help in eliminating noise and artifacts, isolating particular frequency bands, and improving the overall quality of the signal. This repository explains the theory behind FIR filters, their types, and their applications in EEG analysis.

## FIR Filter Theory

### What Are FIR Filters?

What Are FIR Filters?
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #b1c5fc;">Finite Impulse Response (FIR)</span> filters are a class of digital filters with a response that settles to zero in a finite amount of time. This means that the filter's impulse response, or the output of the filter when the input is an impulse, will eventually die out. FIR filters are characterized by their linear phase response, which ensures that the phase of the signal is preserved, making them particularly useful in applications where phase distortion needs to be minimized.

Applications of FIR Filters in EEG

<div style="text-align: justify;">
In EEG signal processing, FIR filters are commonly used to <span style="color: #b1c5fc;">remove unwanted noise and artifacts</span> from the signal. They are designed to <span style="color: #b1c5fc;">filter out specific frequency ranges</span>, such as removing electrical interference (e.g., 50/60 Hz noise) or isolating specific frequency bands related to different brain activities. FIR filters are favored for their <span style="color: #b1c5fc;">stability and predictable behavior</span>, which helps in achieving a clean and reliable signal for further analysis.

### Types of FIR Filters

Types of FIR Filters
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
FIR filters can be categorized into several types based on their frequency response:

- **Low-Pass Filters**: Allow frequencies below a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while attenuating higher frequencies. They are used to remove high-frequency noise from the EEG signal.

- **High-Pass Filters**: Allow frequencies above a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while attenuating lower frequencies. They are useful for removing slow drifts or low-frequency noise from the EEG signal.

- **Band-Pass Filters**: Allow frequencies within a specified range to pass through while attenuating frequencies outside this range. They are used to isolate specific frequency bands of interest, such as alpha or beta waves in EEG.

- **Band-Stop Filters**: Attenuate frequencies within a specified range while allowing frequencies outside this range to pass through. They are used to remove specific frequency components, such as electrical interference, from the EEG signal.

## Requirements

To work with FIR filters and analyze EEG signals, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- **`numpy`**: A library for numerical computations and array manipulations.
- **`pandas`**: A library for data manipulation and analysis, especially for handling CSV files.
- **`matplotlib`**: A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **`scipy`**: A library for scientific and technical computing, including signal processing tools.

You can install these dependencies using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy
